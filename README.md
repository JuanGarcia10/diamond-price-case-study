# IMPORTANT NOTICE

this is a case study from the Udacity nanodegree "Data Analyst". It is not intended to be further developed. The goal is to use proper visualizations for a dataset regarding diamond prices.

## Introduction

We will be working with a dataset regarding the prices and attributes of approximately 54,000 round-cut diamonds. We will go through the steps of an explanatory data visualization, systematically starting from univariate visualizations, moving through bivariate visualizations, and finally multivariate visualizations.

## The Dtaset

**The dataset was supplied by Udacity and will not be uploaded to GitHub.** It consists of ca. 54,000 entries about diamond prices with the following information:

* price: Price in dollars. Data was collected in 2008.
* carat: Diamond weight. 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams.
* cut: Quality of diamond cut, affects its shine. Grades go from (low) Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (best).
* color: Measure of diamond coloration. Increasing grades go from (some color) J, I, H, G, F, E, D (colorless).
* clarity: Measure of diamond inclusions. Increasing grades go from (inclusions) I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (internally flawless).
* x, y, z: Diamond length, width, and depth, respectively, in mm.
* table: Ratio of width of top face of diamond to its overall width, as a percentage.
* depth: Proportional depth of diamond, as a percentage. This is computed as 2 * z / (x + y), or * the ratio of the depth to the average of length and width.
